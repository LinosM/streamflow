# Messaging
The messaging page, is a React app by itself.

The page allow the user after been authenticate, to be able to receive/send instant message to the group that he/she has been assign to. You will also be able to read all the messages from the group.

We integrate this application within the StreamFlow application by utilising the ```<iframe>``` tag.
You can acces the Chat application with the following links:  

[Git Repo](https://github.com/nhounhou/chat-app)  
[Chat Application](https://chat-app-unc.netlify.app/)

This application is simplistic as possible, been part of a final project.  
The management of the user/groups is done thru the [Chat Engine](https://chatengine.io/) webpage. And only the Administrator can create/assign user to groups.  

Few improvements can be added as:
- User updates
- User creating their own groups
- Messaging another user
